26/3/24, 10:24 AM - Mukund Edoofa: Pride, when I discussed the same with her, she mentioned that she has helped more than 100-200 students with the accommodation, and that is why she need to go through her old records to find information about your payments, and since I have asked her for a clear breakup of the payments, it is taking her so much time. However, if I have assured you that I will solve this issue of yours, please don't be worried about that.

27/3/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 405 6847: I am not happy  with the response which Eugene is giving.She knows quite very well the situation here inZimbabwe such that she should have released the breakup of the money  with time

6/4/24, 1:08 PM - +263 77 405 6847: Tatenda told me she fid come the day you called her but Eugene did not meet Tataenda and you.So l think l am now questioning you that are you going to help  me with this issue or else it's like we are playing a Marry go round because it's almost a month since l raised this issue.

I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for sharing these messages with me here Mrs. Mhenzi and I understanding the challenge that you have been facing due to this, however, what I want to say is that, I have been constantly trying to have a discussion with Eugene, but de to different reasons she has not been coming to that conversation and that is why I was not able to share an update with you on that. 

However, stay assured that by tomorrow regardless of anything, you would have the update from my end on this, and most probably the matter will be sorted out as well.
9/4/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 405 6847: You are psychologically  stressing both of us Tatenda and me as a parent.You communicate on this platform when it is your lessons but when it comes to my complaint  you ignore
9/4/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 405 6847: You said you are not going to discuss with me  about the problem of refund/break up of the money.l am still waiting to get the answer from you
9/4/24, 11:20 AM - Mukund Edoofa: No, please Mrs. Mhenzi, I have not said that. Please go through my message again wherein I have mentioned that I would be making sure to solve this matter by tomorrow positively.

9/4/24, 11:51 AM - +263 77 405 6847: If Tatenda was to stay at where she is l would not complain because $485 is not easy to get and you are told to vacate  the house in less than a year and yet she said it was for the whole stay of Tate in lndia for furniture use
9/4/24, 11:53 AM - +263 77 405 6847: It means l have to read get accomotion fees
