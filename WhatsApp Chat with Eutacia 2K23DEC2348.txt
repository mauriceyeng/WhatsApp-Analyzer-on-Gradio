I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion? <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 682 6059: I'm ready
9/1/24, 1:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes you may explain
9/1/24, 2:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
9/1/24, 2:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
9/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes they are clear
9/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
9/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
9/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes I'm following thank you
9/1/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
9/1/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
9/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes they're all clear
9/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
9/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes we may start
9/1/24, 2:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
9/1/24, 2:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
9/1/24, 2:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
9/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes I am you may share

These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

15/1/24, 7:03 AM - +263 71 682 6059: The Open System Interconnection is a reference tool for understanding data communications between any two networked systems.It divides communication processes into seven layers .
Level 1 : The physical layer
It defines connector and interface specifications ,as well as the medium (cable requirements.Electrical , mechanical, functional and procedural specifications are provided for sending a bit stream on a computer network

Level 2:Data link layer
This layer adds physical addresses to the bits of data and control how they are transmitted over the network
Level 3: Network layer
This layer determines the best path for data to travel through the network 
Level 4: Transport layer
Ensures that the data is delivered in the correct order and without errors.
Level 5: Session layer 
Sets up, coordinates and terminates communication sessions between applications
Level 6: Presentation layer

15/1/24, 7:06 AM - +263 71 682 6059: In computer programming, operator overloading is the ability to redefine the meaning of an operator for a specific data type. It allows you to use operators in ways that are different from their standard definition. For example, in the C++ programming language, the "+" operator can be overloaded to add two integers, add two floating-point numbers, or even concatenate two strings. This is useful because it allows you to reuse operators in different contexts, which makes your code more concise and easier to read. Operator overloading is also supported in other programming languages, such as Java, C#, and Python.
15/1/24, 7:07 AM - +263 71 682 6059: Technological advancement can have a huge impact on the economy of developing countries. For example, increased access to the internet and mobile phones can help people access information and services that were previously out of reach. It can also help to increase productivity and efficiency, and create new markets and opportunities for businesses. Technology can also help to improve infrastructure, such as roads, power grids, and water systems. All of these improvements can help to create jobs and boost economic growth. However, it's important to note that technology alone is not enough to develop a country's economy; it must be combined with other factors such as education, health care, and good

15/1/24, 8:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Eutacia and Parents!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the screenshot of the SOP form and answers to the above document. I have taken note of these and will update them in our records.
15/1/24, 12:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Hello Eutacia and Parents!
Are you ready for our session today?
15/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes sir we're ready
15/1/24, 12:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know.
15/1/24, 12:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: We have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
15/1/24, 12:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
15/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes that is accurate
15/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
15/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
15/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
15/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes sir
15/1/24, 1:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
15/1/24, 1:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
15/1/24, 1:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
15/1/24, 1:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
15/1/24, 1:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
15/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Absolutely sir
15/1/24, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
15/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes you can help me
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
15/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes I agree
15/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
15/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
15/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
15/1/24, 3:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you still available @263716826059?
15/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 381 8114: I am so sorry sir the network this side is not favourable
15/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 381 8114: She is trying to respond but heey
15/1/24, 9:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Eutacia and Parents! I hope all of you are doing great. I understand the network challenges that you were facing and to ensure a smooth admission process, we will have our session at 10:00 AM tomorrow to take forward our conversation. I hope by then you will have a good internet connection. We will further connect in our session tomorrow! Wish you a blessed night. <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 10:21 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Noted sir
16/1/24, 10:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Eutacia!
How are you all doing today?
16/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 77 381 8114: Morning sir here we are doing fine
16/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 71 682 6059: Morning sir thank you
16/1/24, 10:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to know that all of you are doing fine. Now, as you know, yesterday we were discussing about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, but due to some network challenges, we were not able to discuss all the aspects of the plan. So may I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
16/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes sir
16/1/24, 10:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: It is good to hear that. May I know if you have any query related to our last conversation? <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 10:33 AM - +263 71 682 6059: At the moment I don't have any query
16/1/24, 10:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Great!
16/1/24, 10:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now taking picking up our conversation where we left off,  there is also another benefit of the Financial Secure Plan. I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 10:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
16/1/24, 10:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
16/1/24, 10:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 77 381 8114: Very true
16/1/24, 10:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
16/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes if you may explain it will benefit me with that knowledge
16/1/24, 10:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263716826059. We are here for your benefit only.
16/1/24, 10:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
16/1/24, 10:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months.
16/1/24, 10:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
16/1/24, 10:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
16/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 77 381 8114: Sure
16/1/24, 10:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/1/24, 10:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
16/1/24, 10:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
16/1/24, 10:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
16/1/24, 10:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
16/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 71 682 6059: Noted sir
16/1/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
16/1/24, 10:53 AM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes sir may you explain it further on what I will be doing in the next 10months
16/1/24, 11:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
16/1/24, 11:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
16/1/24, 11:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
16/1/24, 11:08 AM - +263 71 682 6059: This message was deleted
16/1/24, 11:09 AM - +263 71 682 6059: Ooh it sounds very good
16/1/24, 11:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you understand the financial secure plan now?
16/1/24, 11:19 AM - +263 71 682 6059: Yes I understand
16/1/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
16/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 71 682 6059: I will discuss with them in the evening then we can reconnect on Thursday at 10am
16/1/24, 11:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Thursday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
16/1/24, 11:27 AM - +263 71 682 6059: Same to you sir good bye for now
16/1/24, 11:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Bye @263716826059!

22/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Shadaya and Eutacia!
I hope you are having a great day. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
22/1/24, 4:48 PM - +263 77 381 8114: Yes we are prepared
22/1/24, 5:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are ready for our session. May I know if you have discussed the Edoofa Secure Plan with your family?
22/1/24, 5:09 PM - +263 77 381 8114: Sure we discussed it
22/1/24, 5:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know if you have any queries regarding the plan?
22/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 77 381 8114: Not as yet
22/1/24, 5:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, @263773818114! I have taken note of this. May I know when will you be able to complete the discussion with your family? It will help us to better align the further discussions accordingly.
22/1/24, 6:02 PM - +263 77 381 8114: So far we have discussed  the programme with the family
22/1/24, 6:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, now, to ensure the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide upon the month from which this plan is going to start and a fixed date on which you will positively deposit $150 every month. 


Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail of these opportunities, We completely understand that every parent can't make the payment on our specified date. So considering this situation, we let them decide the plan initiation month and date according to their comfort. So, may I know from what month you wish to start this plan, as well as the fixed date of every month on which you will be able to deposit $150 every month? <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 8:06 PM - +263 77 381 8114: I think 10 June will okay sir
23/1/24, 11:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773818114! I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know about your comfortable dates, but @263773818114 at the time the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is not going to be valid as this plan ensures that the parents or guardians can start preparing at the start of this plan and eventually save the amount accordingly. But if you start around June, you may not have sufficient savings to have at the time of admission into universities. This will eventually become a roadblock in Eutacia's admission journey. I hope you understand my concern?
23/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 71 682 6059: Ooh I understand  so could you please  help  us by suggesting the month     which is comfortable so that we meet the deadline we beg you
23/1/24, 9:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: No need to beg @263716826059. We are here to help you only. You can start with plan as soon as possible. If you depositing soon, you will save more! You can let me know about your fixed date and month of initiation of the plan.
24/1/24, 4:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Shadaya!

24/1/24, 4:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know what is the earliest month at which you can start depositing $150 and the fixed date for the following months as well?

30/1/24, 7:07 PM - +263 77 381 8114: Evening 
Yes we managed to go through it
31/1/24, 10:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr.&Mrs. Shadaya and Eutacia!
I hope you are doing well. Since our operational hours at the time were over when you replied and it had been a long day for me as well, so I was not able to take forward our conversation.

  I am glad to hear that you managed to go through the document. May I know that if you there were any queries that might have come up while reading the document? <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 2:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Eutacia!

I hope you are doing well. I have been expecting a response from your end since yesterday. I shared a reminder with you regarding the Enrollment fee but got no response. May I know if there are any challenges that you are facing in replying to the messages?
1/2/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 381 8114: Afternoon admin we are so sorry we had a network challenge we can go ahead today the network is better
1/2/24, 3:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries @263773818114! The network challenges can be problems for everyone. I understand.
1/2/24, 3:09 PM - +263 77 381 8114: Noted thank you
1/2/24, 3:09 PM - +263 77 381 8114: We appreciate
1/2/24, 3:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Coming back to the agreement, may I know if you have any queries with regards to the agreement?
1/2/24, 3:14 PM - +263 77 381 8114: If I may ask 
What if we fail to pay the first instalment and start the following month would it mean the same with failing to pay for three months
1/2/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for asking this query. But I was not able to understand what you were trying to convey. Can you please help me clarify?
1/2/24, 3:46 PM - +263 77 381 8114: I was saying I promised to pay for the first instalment in March suppose I get a challenge to the effect tha i cannot make it to pay will I be able to pay in the following month the first instalment
1/2/24, 4:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this query @263773818114! In such a case, you can surely pay for the next month, but with a penalty amount as well you will not be able to avail a $150 waiver that is mentioned in the agreement. <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 5:10 PM - +263 77 381 8114: How much will be the penalty for not paying the 150 at the stipulated time
1/2/24, 5:11 PM - +263 77 381 8114: So if I miss the first instalment will I be required to pay 300 in the  following month?
1/2/24, 5:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263773818114, if you fail to pay $150 for a specific month, then you will have to pay the next payment with a penalty that is mentioned against the month in the document and you will not be able to avail the $150 waiver.

Now, if you don't want to miss out on the waiver then you will have to $300 to make up for the missed month in the following month. By doing this, you will be able to avail the waiver. I hope I was able to clear your query.
1/2/24, 6:01 PM - +263 77 381 8114: Noted thank you I now understand it is now clear
2/2/24, 9:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773818114!
I hope you are doing well and I am glad to hear that I was able to clear the queries that were shared by you. May I know when will you be able to print and sign the agreement that was shared with you?
2/2/24, 11:46 AM - +263 77 381 8114: On Monday morning
2/2/24, 1:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263773818114! But may I know, what is the reason behind it?  As it usually requires a day to print and sign the agreement. May I know if there are any challenges?
2/2/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 381 8114: I thought maybe since tomorrow and Sunday is weekend but if ever we can do it tomorrow it's still fine I thought you will not be available during weekend
2/2/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: You can surely send the signed document tomorrow only @263773818114. We have our operational hours on Saturdays from 8:00 AM to 1:30 PM. We have holidays on Sunday.

19/3/24, 12:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. Shadaya!
I hope you are doing well. Yes, the above news is true. However, it needs to be noted that the mentioned universities are not associated with Edoofa. The universities that are mentioned, we as an organization have recognized these universities and have always counseled the students to be aware of such universities from the very beginning, however, some of them neglected such warnings and therefore, suffered. Now, the Zimbabwean government has recognized this problem and has taken this step.

For reassurance, I would like you to not worry as Edoofa is associated with such universities.
